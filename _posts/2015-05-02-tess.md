The [Triennial Earth-Sun Summit (TESS)](https://aas.org/meetings/tess2015), a joint meeting between the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), took place from 26-30 April in Indianapolis, IN, USA. Joint meetings like TESS provide a unique opportunity for space plasma physicists studying the solar corona, Earth's magnetosphere, and the solar wind to discuss the intersections of their respective fields. Dr. Stephen Bradshaw delivered a talk entitled [Pinning Down Coronal Heating Properties in the Presence of Non-Equilibrium Ionization](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015TESS....120405B) and Will Barnes presented a poster entitled [Non-negative Matrix Factorization as a Method for Studying Coronal Heating](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015TESS....120306B).  Some exciting observational results regarding the viability of nanoflares as a coronal heating mechanism was also presented.
