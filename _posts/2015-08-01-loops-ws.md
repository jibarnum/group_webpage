Dr. Stephen Bradshaw and graduate student Will Barnes attended the [Seventh Coronal Loops Workshop](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/astro/cl7/index.html), hosted by the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, from 21-23 July 2015. The meeting, held every two years since 2002, discussed past and present achievements as well as future challenges in the field of coronal loop physics. Dr. Bradshaw chaired the session on "Fine Scale Structure and Non-equilibrium Processes" and served on the local and scientific organizing committees. Will presented a poster entitled *Effects of Ion Heating on Emission Measure of Coronal Loops in Active Region Cores.*  A complete program of the conference can be found [here](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/astro/cl7/program.html).
