title: New Paper on Nanoflare Signatures in Active Region Cores
---
Graduate student Will Barnes and Dr. Stephen Bradshaw, along with Peter Cargill of Imperial College, London and the University of St Andrews, recently published a paper in The Astrophysical Journal entitled [Inference of Heating Properties from "Hot" Non-flaring Plasmas in Active Region Cores. I. Single Nanoflares](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160804776B). 

Additionally, the entire text as well as the code to run (nearly all of) the simulations, do the analysis, and build the plots can be found [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/hot_plasma_single_nanoflares). Install instructions have been provided to make it relatively easy for others to download the code plus associated dependencies and reproduce the results of the paper almost entirely from scratch with a ["one-button workflow"](https://github.com/jhamrick/nbflow).
