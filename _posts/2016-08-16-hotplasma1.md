Will and Steve recently published a paper with Peter Cargill (Imperial College, St. Andrews) on the emission signatures of single nanoflares. This is the first in a series on observational signatures of nanoflares of varying frequency. You can read the paper [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...829...31B). We've also provided [the code](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/hot_plasma_single_nanoflares) to reproduce the paper from scratch.
