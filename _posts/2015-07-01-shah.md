title: Bradshaw research group gains new member
---
This past summer Shah Bahauddin joined the Bradshaw research group. Shah, currently a second-year student at Rice, was formerly a member of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering where he specialized in nanophotonics and ultra-fast lasers. Shah's current project in the solar group focuses on analysis of spectroscopic data from [IRIS](http://iris.lmsal.com/index.html) combined with advanced hydrodynamic simulations in an effort to determine transition region signatures of impulsively-heated coronal loops.
