Will and Steve recently published a paper with Nicki Viall (NASA GSFC) on modeling observable signatures of nanoflare heating frequency in a multi-loop active region model. The ADS entry is [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...880...56B/abstract) and the source code to reproduce the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/synthetic-observables-paper-models).
