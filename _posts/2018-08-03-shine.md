The Rice solar group recently attended the [2018 SHINE Workshop](http://shinecon.org/CurrentMeeting.php) in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Alison, Anthony, Revati, Shah and Will presented the following posters on their research:

* "Simulation of Exoplanet Host Star Magnetic Activity on Stellar Cycle Timescales", *Alison Farrish*
* "Predicting Radio Emission of Exoplanets in Enhanced Stellar Wind Environments", *Anthony Sciola*
* "Predicting the dynamics and spectral evolution of a C-class solar flare with a numerical and forward modeling approach", *Revati Mendage*
* "Understanding the Energy Balance of Transition Region Structures observed by Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph", *Shah Bahauddin*
* "Using Synthetic and Observed Timelags to Constrain Nanoflare Heating Frequency in Active Region Cores", *Will Barnes*

Will and Steve, in collaboration with Nicki Viall at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, chaired a session on ["Signatures of Time-dependent Heating in Active Regions and the Slow Solar Wind"](https://rice-solar-physics.github.io/shine-2018/). Additionally, David and Anthony chaired a session on ["Observational Signatures of Star-Planet Interactions"](http://shinecon.org/shine2018/session2018.php#session2).
