  description: "ebtel++ is a C++ implementation of the Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) model for efficiently modeling the dynamics of coronal loops. In particular, ebtel++ solves a set of time-dependent, spatially-averaged two-fluid hydrodynamic equations. The details of the original model can be found in [Klimchuk et al. (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...682.1351K), [Cargill et al. (2012a)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...752..161C), and [Cargill et al. (2012b)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...758....5C) and a description of the two-fluid model can be found in [Barnes et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...829...31B). The [original IDL code](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/EBTEL) is also maintained by the Rice solar group."

- name: "IonPopSolver"
  description: "IonPopSolver solves the time-dependent ionization equations for a particular element given tabulated values of the plasma electron temperature and density. These tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical model, the output from a numerical simuation, or a set of observational measurements. A full description of the numerical model and relevant physics can be found in [Bradshaw (2009)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...502..409B)."
