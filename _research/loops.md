### Introduction
The solar corona

* Brief intro to corona and what loops are
* Why they are important
* Observations

### Equations
The field-aligned equations describing loop hydrodynamics are given by,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}t} = -n\frac{\partial v}{\partial s} \\
$$

### Numerics
Describe work done on EBTEL and HYDRAD

* HYDRAD picture/movie?
* EBTEL T,n,h curves
