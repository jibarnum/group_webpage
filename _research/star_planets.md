We are building global magnetic field models for active stars and calculating the total extreme ultra-violet and X-ray radiation from their atmospheres, based on our experience with the Sun. One of our aims is to determine how strongly extra-solar planets can be irradiated by this energetic electromagnetic radiation from their parent stars, which has important consequences for their atmospheric chemistry and habitability.
