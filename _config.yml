description:      'The **Solar Physics Research Group** at **Rice University** uses computational modeling and observational tools to explore a variety of topics in solar and space plasma physics. Our current [research projects](/Research.html) range from forward modeling of nanoflare-heated solar active regions to magnetic interactions between stars and planets. We are housed within the Department of Physics and Astronomy and located primarily in [Herman Brown Hall for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.rice.edu/maps/Rice-University-Color-Campus-Map.pdf).'
